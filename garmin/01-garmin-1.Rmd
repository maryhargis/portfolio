#question 1 - are my runs better on the treadmill or outside on the road?

##processing
```{r}
#what makes a "good run" can vary depending on you talk to! Some runners are all about pace (minutes per mile), others are all about cadence (foot turnover). Overall, it's a pretty undefined ask. Below, I specify two ways to conceptualize a "good" run and analyze accordingly.

#1a: operationalizing a "good" run as a faster pace -- minutes per mile
good_run_fast <- garmin_running %>% 
  select(activity_type, distance, time, avg_pace, best_pace,  max_temp, aerobic_te) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(distance, max_temp), as.numeric)) %>% filter(activity_type != "Trail Running")
#converting time data from character to time
good_run_fast <- good_run_fast %>% 
  mutate(total_time = hms(time),
         total_hours = hour(total_time),
         total_minutes = minute(total_time),
         total_seconds = second(total_time),
         total_time_in_minutes =(total_seconds / 60) + total_minutes) %>%
  mutate(avg_pace = ms(avg_pace),
         avg_pace_minutes = minute(avg_pace),
         avg_pace_seconds = second(avg_pace)) %>%
  mutate(avg_pace_in_minutes = (avg_pace_seconds/60)+avg_pace_minutes) %>%
  mutate(aerobic_te = as.numeric(aerobic_te))


#1b: operationalizing a "good" run using cadence (faster running needs higher foot turnover)
good_run_cadence <- garmin_running  %>% select(activity_type, distance, avg_pace, avg_run_cadence, max_temp, aerobic_te) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(distance, max_temp), as.numeric)) %>% filter(activity_type != "Trail Running")
#converting time data from character to time
good_run_cadence <- good_run_cadence %>% 
  mutate(avg_pace = ms(avg_pace),
         avg_pace_minutes = minute(avg_pace),
         avg_pace_seconds = second(avg_pace)) %>%
  mutate(avg_pace_in_seconds = (avg_pace_seconds/60)+avg_pace_minutes) %>%
  mutate(avg_run_cadence = as.numeric(avg_run_cadence))%>%
  mutate(aerobic_te = as.numeric(aerobic_te))

```

##analysis
###descriptives
```{r}
#descriptives
##1a
describeBy(good_run_fast$avg_pace_in_minutes, good_run_fast$activity_type) #226 regular runs,  105 treadmill runs 
##1b

###initial visualization
```{r}
#1a: good run = fast run
fast_plot <- good_run_fast %>% 
  ggplot(aes (x = max_temp, y = avg_pace_in_minutes, group = activity_type, fill = activity_type))+
  geom_area() +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    ggtitle("Visualizing fastest runs") +
    theme(legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
      plot.title = element_text(size=13)
    ) + 
    facet_wrap(~activity_type, scale="free_y")

fast_plot

#1b: good run = fast cadence
cadence_plot <- good_run_cadence %>% 
  ggplot(aes (x = max_temp, y = avg_run_cadence, group = activity_type, fill = activity_type))+
  geom_area() +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    ggtitle("Visualizing fastest runs") +
    theme(legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
      plot.title = element_text(size=13)
    ) + 
    facet_wrap(~activity_type, scale="free_y")

cadence_plot

#these plots show us that pace and cadence are pretty variable, especially among "regular runs" (outdoor runs)/ that's the most common run type.  
max(good_run_fast$max_temp) #hottest temp during a run was 98.6 -- I don't recommend running in weather that hot, but I do live in Las Vegas!
```

###regression models
```{r}

#bare-bones models
fast_model_simple <- lm(avg_pace_in_minutes ~activity_type, data = good_run_fast)
summary(fast_model_simple) #non-sig effect of activity type on pace


cadence_model_simple <- lm(avg_run_cadence ~ activity_type, data = good_run_cadence)
summary(cadence_model_simple)#non-sig effect of activity type on cadence


#other variables that affect pace include temperature, distance traveled, aerobic exertion. variable of interest here is activity type.

fast_model <- lm(avg_pace_in_minutes ~ max_temp + distance + aerobic_te +  activity_type, data = good_run_fast)
summary(fast_model)
#results: 
#-farther distance: slower pace; 
#-more exertion: faster pace; 
#-no effect of temp. 
#-Outdoor runs are the reference group; treadmill runs are faster pace!

cadence_model <- lm(avg_run_cadence ~ max_temp + distance + aerobic_te +  activity_type, data = good_run_cadence)
summary(cadence_model)
#results: 
#-farther distance: slower cadence (tired legs = slow cadence!); 
#-more exertion: higher cadence; 
#-no effect of temp. 
#-Outdoor runs are the reference group; treadmill runs are slower cadence!
```



#question 2: on days when I manage to keep my heart rate low, how do I perform compared to higher HR days?
```{r}
#...to be continued!

## Projects

### Predicting assessment performance using IXL's analytics
[Publication]([https://www.ixl.com/materials/us/research/Predicting_Performance_on_ILEARN.pdf])

Developed and executed optimal strategy for assessing psychometric properties of IXL's Diagnostic using _**R**_ -- the first study of this size. This data-driven approach filled an existing research gap and was a crucial component of IXL's eligibility for a grant (RFP) with the state of Indiana (total allocation of $14,000,000). My method provides a comprehensive assessment of IXL's predictive validity, reliability, AUC, and classification accuracy, further demonstrating the Diagnostic's strong ability to predict performance on state assessments.

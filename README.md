### Work Experience
Research Scientist, IXL Learning (2022-present)
- Published over 25 solo-author studies on IXL's efficacy and psychometric properties
- Analyzed data from over 1,000,000 Indiana students to validate IXL's assessment suite
- Using R (tidyverse, ggplot2, lme4, etc) to translate large, raw datasets into actionable insights and impact

## Projects

### Predicting assessment performance using IXL's analytics
[Publication]([https://www.ixl.com/materials/us/research/Predicting_Performance_on_ILEARN.pdf])
Developed and executed optimal strategy for assessing psychometric properties of IXL's Diagnostic -- the first study of this size. This data-driven approach filled an existing research gap and was a crucial component of IXL's eligibility for a grant (RFP) with the state of Indiana (total allocation of $14,000,000). My method provides a comprehensive assessment of IXL's predictive validity, reliability, AUC, and classification accuracy, further demonstrating the Diagnostic's strong ability to predict performance on state assessments.
